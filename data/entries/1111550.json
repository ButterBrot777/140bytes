removes css class names from element `class` attribute.\n\nSupports regexp as a class name (thing I wait from jQuery for years).\n\nPreserves order, leaves no duplicate or trailing spaces in `className`.\n\nRegexp-related info\n-------------------\n\nRegexp should be matched fully, not partially.\n\n`/foo-.*/` will match `'foo-bar'` in `'foo-bar baz'`\n\n`/foo-/` will not.\n\n`^` and `$` means start and end of class name chunk, not of the whole `className` string\n\n`i` (case-independent) modifier search is supported\n\n`m` (multiline) modifier has no meaning\n\n`g` (global) modifier is ignored: all search behaves as global\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n`removeClass(o, c)`\n\n`o` *required* object whose className is changed\n\n`c` *required* class name: regexp or string (or anything that
