Input is entered as solely lower case letters (no numbers, spaces, special characters etc). Outputs may be verified against http://sharkysoft.com/misc/vigenere/\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nAs described on http://ub.ly/um (the parser chokes on the full URL), the essence of the Vignere cypher is that it is a cyclic version of the Caesar shift cypher. It's not unbreakable but it's pretty good. Also, as a corollary we get rot13 (use \"n\" as an encoding parameter - yes, as originally defined there's a one byte offset from what you might expect...) and of course Caesar.\n\nEntry History\n-------------\nMy initial attempts were encryption only (138b):\n\n```javascript\nfunction(j,s,h,g,i,n){for(g=\"\",i=0;i-j.length;g+=String.fromCharCode(n?n+64:90))n=(j.charCodeAt(i)+s.charCodeAt(i++%s.length)+15)%26;h(g)}\n```\n\nand encryption + decryption (151b):\n\n```javascript\nfunction(j,s,h,t,g,i,n){for(g=\"\",i=0;i-j.length;g+=String.fromCharCode(n?n+64:90))n=(j.charCodeAt(i)+t*s.charCodeAt(i++%s.length)+(t>0?15:27))%26;h(g)}\n```\n\nwith t=+/- 1 being encryption/decryption. Thanks to all the help in the comments (especially @subzey!) this is now down to 138b, with both encryption and decryption.\n\nWhat I learnt\n-------------\n\nThe phrases \"fromCharCode\", \"charCodeAt\" and \"String\" are FAR too long =( \n\nSavings don't always come where you expect them to (see @jed's ultimately unused 'harCode' hack in the comments). In fact, from my experience so far in 140byt.es, they most often come from some slight (or indeed major!) reworking of the algorithm (c.f. the successive contributions to fibonacci, base64 enc/dec etc).\n\nhttp://esparser.qfox.nl/ is
