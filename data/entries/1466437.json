No, really\n\n```\n>> typeof console.log\n   \"object\"\n```\n\nSo it cannot be `.call`'ed or `.apply`'ed or be set as callback to `String.prototype.replace`. That's unfair.\n\nThis function wraps native `console.log` method into a function so it becomes a function again. It does nothing with normal browsers and older ones. It takes no arguments and returns nothing.\n\n\nFor more information\n--------------------\n\nSee the [140byt.es](http://140byt.es) site for a showcase of entries (built itself using 140-byte entries!), and follow [@140bytes](http://twitter.com/140bytes) on Twitter.\n\nTo learn about byte-saving hacks for your own code, or to contribute what you've learned, head to [the wiki](https://github.com/jed/140bytes/wiki/Byte-saving-techniques).\n\n140byt.es is brought to you by [Jed Schmidt](http://jed.is), with help from Alex Kloss.
