I was wondering, how much of this nifty, widespread code could be squished into 140 bytes.\n\nCurrently, this is ~~158~~ 154 bytes and I'm looking for your help. One thing I could do is to remove `a.focus();` and `+b.length` but doing so I will loose a major feature. I'm looking for other ways to make this smaller."},"LICENSE.txt":{"type":"text/plain","filename":"LICENSE.txt","raw_url":"https://gist.github.com/raw/1501501/1e0ded331fde4d20d171835d47bdd50b1fafe94f/LICENSE.txt","language":"Text","size":488,"content":"            DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\n                    Version 2, December 2004\n\n Copyright (C) 2011 Thiemo Mättig <http://maettig.com>\n\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified\n copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long\n as the name is changed.\n\n            DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0.
